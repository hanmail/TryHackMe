//Learn Linux via TryHackMe

If this is your first time using TryHackMe you will need to connect to their openVPN server, this grants you access to contents you may need to do their courses Assuming we are using free TryHackMe) / Highly recommended to complete the "Welcome" room, before starting this!
- https://www.tryhackme.com/access  -> On this page, highly recommended on top right to "Switch your VPN", connect to the one geographically closest to you.
- Two methods of connecting through to their open VPN servers. Download OpenVPN and connect through using "Connect using openVPN" or through terminal access.
  -- terminal access is done through installing the openVPN package. In Linux use -> sudo apt install openvpn -> Download configuration file -> sudo openvpn <your_file_name>
  -- Note, please ensure that you're in the same directory for the terminal as your config file.
  -- This will then connect through properly under Network Information where "connected" will be ticked.
- All machines behave simiarly where there will be an active-machine information displayed. You can add up to an hour of additional time / terminate the room session, some may require the premium version to access or to extend time on the lessons/labs.
